## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This is a pretty simple frontend implementation. Summary page has been added with radio buttons to choose document for which to show summary.

API endpoint used: http://localhost:8000/summarize/


## Further possible work

I focused on the back end. This could be beautified, other functionalities (if added) would have to be setup.
